# Wheels
- Wide v.s. Thin
	- affect surface area in contact with ground, affecting how rubber gets squished
- Size (i.e. diameter) affects
	- size of cavity to allow steering
	- torque
		- larger the diameter, moment of inertia is higher, more torque required
	- distance travelled per revolution
- Mass
