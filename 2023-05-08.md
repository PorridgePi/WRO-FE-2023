- Note: 3.7 It is not allowed to use a vehicleâ€™s control program that is (a.) the same or too similar to solutions sold online or (b.) the same or too similar to another solution at the competition and clearly not the own work of the team. This includes solutions from teams of the same institution and/or country. Since manufactured vehicles/sets can be used in the competition, the constructions of vehicles are not checked for plagiarism.

One car per attempt will try to achieve the best time by driving several laps fully autonomously. The two challenges are the following:

Open Challenge: The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with random placements of the inside track walls.

Obstacle Challenge: The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with randomly placed green and red traffic signs. The traffic signs indicate the side of the lane the vehicle must follow. The traffic sign to keep to the right side of the lane is a red pillar. The traffic sign to keep to the left side of the lane is a green pillar. The continuation of the vehicle to the third round is indicated by the last traffic sign of the second round. A green traffic sign indicates that the robot must go ahead and continue the third round in the same direction. A red traffic sign indicates that the vehicle must turn around and complete the third round in the opposite direction. The vehicle is not allowed to move or knock down the traffic signs.

The starting direction in which the car must drive on the track (clockwise or counterclockwise) will vary in different challenge rounds. The starting position of the car as well as the number and location of traffic signs are randomly defined before the round (after the check time). The following graphic shows the game field with the game objects.
