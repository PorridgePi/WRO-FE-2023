1. Mobility Management
	1. Motor used for propulsion was the GM25-12CPR.
		1. Advantages
			1. Came with an encoder with a 1440 BPR resolution, combined with a 1:34 inline gear box, allowed for an actual resolution of 1/136th of a degree
			3. Low stall current of 2A while providing sufficient maximum RPM and torque.
		2. Implementation
			1. The motor came with a metal bracket which was used to attach it.
		3. Possible Alternatives
			1. Joinmax geared motors were also considered but deemed unsuitable as it had a significantly higher current draw, poor performance at low voltages and lacked an encoder.
The GM25-12CPR was chosen as it had an inline gearbox allowing us to mount it lower down to improve the stability. It had a relatively low stall current of 2A while giving us more than enough torque and RP
