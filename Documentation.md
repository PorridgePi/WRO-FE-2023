1. Mobility Management
	1. Motor used for propulsion was the GM25-12CPR.
		1. Advantages
			1. It had an inline gearbox so we could mount it low down, to improve stability, while not taking up too much space.
			2. Came with an encoder with a 1440 BPR resolution, allowing for more reliable tracking of the vehicle's position.
			3. Low stall current of 2A while providing sufficient maximum RPM and torque.
			4. Motor came with a mount.
		2. Alternatives
			1. Joinmax geared motors were also considered but deemed excessive as it had a significantly 
The GM25-12CPR was chosen as it had an inline gearbox allowing us to mount it lower down to improve the stability. It had a relatively low stall current of 2A while giving us more than enough torque and RP
