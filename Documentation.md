1. Mobility Management
	1. Motor used for propulsion was the GM25-12CPR.
		1. Advantages
			1. Came with an encoder with a 1440 BPR resolution, combined with a 1:34 inline gear box, allowed for an actual resolution of 1/136th of a degree.
			2. Low stall current of 2A while providing sufficient maximum RPM and torque.
		2. Implementation
			1. The motor came with a metal bracket which was used to attach it.
			2. Its relatively low profile allowed it to be mounted lower down without taking up too much vertical space to improve stability.

		3. ~~Possible Alternatives~~
			1. ~~Joinmax geared motors were also considered but deemed unsuitable as it had a significantly higher current draw, poor performance at low voltages and lacked an encoder.~~
		4. The chassis was designed with articulated steering in mind, which allowed for larger steering angles while keeping the steering mechanism relatively simple, with a single servo rotating the steering wheels through a single shaft as opposed to more conventional steering with multiple links 
		5. All the heavy components like the motor and battery were mounted as low as possible to improve stability allowing for faster speeds and tighter turning if needed.
