			- > On Raspberry Pi 3 and earlier devices running Bullseye you need to re-enable Glamor in order to make the X-Windows hardware accelerated preview window work. To do this enter sudo raspi-config at a terminal window and then choose Advanced Options, Glamor and Yes. Finally quit raspi-config and let it reboot your Raspberry Pi.
			- > Raspberry Pi 3 and older devices may not by default be using the correct display driver. Refer to the /boot/config.txt file and ensure that either dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d or dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d is currently active. Please reboot if you needed to change this.
